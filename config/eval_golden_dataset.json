    "question": "What is the role and importance of the 'Dry_Clover_g' component in pasture modeling?",
    "ground_truth": "Dry_Clover_g captures the nitrogen-fixing clover component, which is essential for maintaining pasture nutrition.",
    "context_answer": "Dry_Clover_g represents the dry-matter clover (legume) fraction. Clover is modeled separately because it is nutritionally important and contributes via nitrogen fixation, influencing pasture productivity and composition."

    "question": "Over what time period and in which regions was the data collection conducted?",
    "ground_truth": "Data was collected over a three-year period from 2014 to 2017 across 19 locations in four Australian states: New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and Western Australia.",
    "context_answer": "Data collection spanned three years (2014–2017) across 19 sites in four Australian states: New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and Western Australia."

  {
    "question": "Why was sampling avoided immediately after rainfall events?",
    "ground_truth": "Sampling was avoided after rain to prevent soil contamination and to maintain consistent measurement conditions.",
    "context_answer": "Sampling was avoided immediately after rainfall to reduce soil contamination risk and to keep sampling/measurement conditions consistent."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the specific technical challenge associated with using capacitance meters?",
    "ground_truth": "Capacitance meters require complex, pasture-specific calibration and often yield inconsistent results across different environmental conditions.",
    "context_answer": "Capacitance meters require complex, pasture-specific calibration and can produce inconsistent results when environmental and pasture conditions vary."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the specific temperature and time requirements for drying the pasture samples?",
    "ground_truth": "All fractions were dried at 70°C for a duration of 48 hours following standard protocols.",
    "context_answer": "All separated sample fractions were dried at 70°C for 48 hours according to standard protocols."

  {
    "question": "What is the goal of the MABe22 dataset?",
    "ground_truth": "The goal of the MABe22 dataset is to benchmark representation learning models for behavior analysis using data from biology experiments.",
    "context_answer": "MABe22 is designed to benchmark representation learning methods for behavior analysis using data collected from biology experiments."
  },
  {
    "question": "What organisms are included in the MABe22 dataset?",
    "ground_truth": "The MABe22 dataset includes data from three model organisms: mice, beetles (rove beetles), and flies (fruit flies).",
    "context_answer": "MABe22 includes three model organisms: mice, rove beetles, and fruit flies."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of ablation study was performed for the video representation learning methods?",
    "ground_truth": "For each video representation learning method, we perform an ablation study on the key hyperparameter for the respective method and its effect on downstream task performance.",
    "context_answer": "For each video representation learning method, an ablation varies that method’s key hyperparameter and measures the resulting impact on downstream task performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What dimensionality (D) is used for the learned representations across different methods?",
    "ground_truth": "For video models, D is 128. For trajectory methods, D is 128 for mice and 256 for flies.",
    "context_answer": "The learned representation dimensionality is D=128 for video models. For trajectory methods, D=128 for mice and D=256 for flies."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which state-of-the-art video representation models and backbones are evaluated?",
    "ground_truth": "The methods include Masked Autoencoder (MAE) with ViT-B, MaskFeat with MViTv2-S, and pBYOL with a SlowFast backbone.",
    "context_answer": "Evaluated state-of-the-art video representation approaches include MAE with a ViT-B backbone, MaskFeat with an MViTv2-S backbone, and ρBYOL using a SlowFast backbone."
